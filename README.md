Title : SmtAda - A Simple Ada Backend Support Framework for Smt-provers

Author : David Pereira (dmrpe@isep.ipp.pt)

Short Description:

This SmtAda, a set of Smt-provers bindings to the Ada programming language. The main
goal of SmtAda is to provide users with easy access to the power of automated provers
when they are writting their Ada code. In this way, the user gains access to powerful
logical reasoning methods at the code level, without the need to use formal verification
platforms supporting Ada.

This project is still under its first development steps, so no guarantees of 
the correctness of the code are given. If you find bugs or have suggestions to
improvements, non-supported provers of interest, or any other point you wish
to make about this project, please send me an email. I will be more than glad
to listen to you thoughts!

The currently supported Smt provers are :
 - CVC3, and CVC4 ;
 - Z3 ;
 - Yices 1.

TODO:
 - High-level SMT-Lib v2. supports ;
 - Support for MathSat, Yices 2, and alt-ergo
